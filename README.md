I'm a passionate Software Developer with a keen eye for detail and a talent for collaborating with clients to bring their visions to life. My background in manufacturing engineering ignited my interest in technology and coding, leading me to self-study web development for over a year before enrolling in the Makers Academy Bootcamp. Leveraging the skills I honed as a CNC Programming Engineer in aerospace, I made a career transition into coding, fueled by my newfound love for software engineering. I've dedicated extensive hours to mastering web development, from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to advanced technologies like React, Node.js, and Python, with invaluable support from Makers Academy.

## üßë‚Äçüîß Skills

### Problem-solving

Problem-solving has always been an integral part of my daily life, and my role as a manufacturing engineer provided a platform to nurture and elevate this skill. A notable experience occurred during my time as a CNC programming engineer, where I was given the challenge of producing an exceptionally complex component using innovative CNC techniques and recently acquired software. This program demanded extensive exploration, diligent research, and a degree of trial and error to achieve the desired level of quality. By successfully transitioning the manufacturing of this component in-house, we achieved substantial cost savings and significantly enhanced our ability to deliver shorter lead times to our customers. This experience highlights my proficiency in problem-solving and my commitment to driving efficiency and quality improvements.

### Pair Programming

Throughout my time at the Makers Bootcamp, I actively embraced pair programming as a fundamental practice in software development. This experience honed my collaborative skills, fostered effective communication, and equipped me to tackle intricate coding challenges alongside colleagues. It showcases my adaptability, technical proficiency, and readiness to excel in a team-centric work environment, making me an asset to any software development team.

### Leadership

While enrolled in the Makers Bootcamp, I proactively volunteered to lead the team in conducting demos and our retrospective at the conclusion of our first group project. This decision was a deliberate step outside my comfort zone, driven by the desire to strengthen my skills in areas where I felt less confident. Guiding this session proved to be both an enriching and enjoyable experience. It not only allowed us as a team to reflect collectively on our first group project but also fostered open communication. I  was able to engage with my peers, gaining valuable insights into their experiences and identifying common themes within the feedback and comments shared. This experience highlighted my commitment to teamwork and continuous improvement in our collaborative learning environment.

### Teaching

During my time at Makers, one of the skills I really benefitted from was the ability to help and teach others. I actively engaged in a culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing. I took the initiative to assist fellow members of the cohort by providing guidance and support on challenging exercises and better insight into some of the material. This experience allowed me to reinforce my own understanding of programming concepts while helping my peers overcome obstacles. It also demonstrated my strong teamwork and communication skills, reinforcing my commitment to promoting a collaborative learning environment within the workplace.

### Organisation / Planning

In my role as a Programming Engineer at Ipeco, I consistently played a proactive role in project organisation and planning. This entailed the development of comprehensive progress tracking systems to monitor tasks and guarantee the on-time delivery of time-sensitive projects. Additionally, I introduced a skills' matrix to identify optimal task scheduling, ensuring efficient project execution and resource allocation.

### Emotional Intelligence

While collaborating on projects, I encountered situations where conflicts of interest and interpersonal dynamics could potentially disrupt the team's synergy. In such instances, I recognized the significance of maintaining a harmonious and supportive work environment for all team members. In a specific project, I assumed a leadership role within the group, actively addressing and mitigating these challenges. I also took the initiative to engage with individuals privately, ensuring their comfort and providing a safe space for open discussions about any personal challenges they may have been facing.

### Ambition

In the summer of 2022, I proactively pursued my ambition to become a software developer. I dedicated time to learn new languages and technologies, built personal projects and a developer portfolio website for employment prospects, and completed a four-month coding bootcamp. This showcases my ambition and commitment to a software engineering career.
