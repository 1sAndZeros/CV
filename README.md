I am a **junior developer** with a passion for creating intuitive and engaging software. I take pride in my attention to detail and my ability to collaborate with clients to ensure their vision is brought to life. Although my background is in manufacturing engineering, I have always been interested in **technology** and **coding**, and I've been teaching myself **web development** for over a year before embarking on the **Makers Academy Bootcamp**. After honing my trade in the world of aerospace, I am transferring the skills I have built as a CNC **Programming Engineer** over to a profession in **coding**. After discovering my love for **coding**, I decided to transition into a career in tech and pursue my passion for **software engineering**. I've dedicated countless hours to learning the ins and outs of **web development**, from **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to more advanced topics like **React** and **Node.js** as well as taking a deeper dive into **Python** with the help of the Makers.
